I went to school with a high population of unruly children. Do you know how many times I have seen young children stomp (literally stomp to kill) other people?

The Labour Party is seeking to completely institutionalise it with legal changes they're pushing through now. But positive discrimination has excited in council housing, in the police force, certain police forces won't even accept white, i.e. English or Scottish or Irish or Welsh or third generation Poles as recruits because they can't have any more recruits until they have more ethnic minority recruits because the ethnic minorities in Somerset and Sussex... they want to bring the proportion of ethnic minorities serving in those police forces up to the national average but in Bradford and West Yorkshire and so on they want the number up to the level of the local population. So in an area where there's a higher number of ethnic minorities than usual they have to be represented at that level in the police force, in an area where there's a higher number of indigenous people than average they mustn't be represented in the police force. That is discrimination. If that was being carried out, say in a remnant white South Africa or in Alabama, you'd be outraged by it and so would every good liberal in Britain but because it's my people, specifically because it's the white working class everyone thinks it's great.

They decided early on these women could not be feminist, indeed must be against everything that feminism stands for, that the hijab was a symbol of oppression.

This contempt is ironic: it is assumed these women wear a scarf as they are forced to do so by their menfolk, and that the solution to that undue influence is to expel them from school and send them back to the same oppressive families. If French feminists saw scarf-wearing Muslims as oppressed women, it should be a reason not to expel them from school or to curtail their movements, but to actually embrace them.

They also obnoxiously will attempt to buy any jewelry or electronics off of you (""Nice camera! I buy? I buy? How much? How much?""). So, unfortunately, the stereotype of Romani being thieves has some truth to it. But can you blame them? It's like an earlier poster said: it's kinda a vicious cycle.
