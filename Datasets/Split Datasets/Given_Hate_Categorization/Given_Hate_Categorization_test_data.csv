Paul however  was more inclusive and preached for a racially harmonious Christianity where ""there is no Jew or Greek for we are all one in Christ Jesus"", and (presumably as the Greeks found circumcision unpalatable) wherein the Old Testament Jewish law is abolished and faith/righteousness is all that matters.

They also obnoxiously will attempt to buy any jewelry or electronics off of you (""Nice camera! I buy? I buy? How much? How much?""). So, unfortunately, the stereotype of Romani being thieves has some truth to it. But can you blame them? It's like an earlier poster said: it's kinda a vicious cycle.
